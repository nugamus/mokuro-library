# Authentication

Multi-user support with separate reading progress, bookmarks, and preferences per account.

## Quick Start

**First time:** Click "Create an account" on the login screen. First registered user becomes admin.

**Returning:** Login with your credentials. Sessions persist until explicit logout.

**Logout:** Menu → Logout (bottom of menu)

## Multi-User Features

See [Reader Settings](/reader-settings) for details.

## Security

### Passwords
Use strong passwords (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols). Don't reuse passwords.

### Server Deployment
For production deployments:
- Use HTTPS with SSL/TLS (Let's Encrypt)
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy)
- Enable firewall rules
- Keep application updated
- Regular database backups

## Data & Privacy

All user data stored in SQLite database:
```
backend/mokuro-library.db
```

Stored per user:
- Username (encrypted)
- Password (bcrypt hashed)
- Reading progress
- Preferences (JSON)
- Session tokens

**Backup regularly:**
```bash
cp backend/mokuro-library.db backend/mokuro-library.db.backup
```

## Multi-Device

Same account works across desktop, tablet, and phone. Progress syncs automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't login:** Verify username/password (case-sensitive), clear browser cache, or contact admin.

**Session expired:** Check server hasn't restarted. SESSION_SECRET should be set in server config.

**Registration fails:** Ensure password is 6+ characters and both password fields match.
