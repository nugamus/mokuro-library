## What is Mokuro Library?

Mokuro Library transforms your [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro)-processed manga into a fully-featured, self-hosted library server. Unlike the original browser-based Mokuro reader, this is a **server-side application** that runs persistently on your home server, NAS, or cloud instance.

### Why Use Mokuro Library?

**Perfect for serious manga readers who want:**

- 🏠 **Self-Hosted Control** - Your data stays on your server, not in browser storage
- 📱 **Multi-Device Sync** - Access your library from any device with seamless progress sync
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Sharing** - Multiple user accounts with individual progress and settings
- 💽 **No Storage Limits** - Manage large libraries without browser quota restrictions
- 📝 **Persistent Edits** - OCR corrections save directly to your `.mokuro` files
- 🎯 **Professional Features** - Advanced organization, metadata management, and bulk operations

### How It Works

1. **Process Your Manga** - Use [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro) to extract OCR data from your manga
2. **Upload to Library** - Import processed folders into Mokuro Library
3. **Read & Enjoy** - Access from any browser with your personalized reading experience
4. **Edit & Improve** - Correct OCR text and save changes permanently
