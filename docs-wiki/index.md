# Welcome to the Mokuro Library User Guide

Mokuro Library is a self-hosted, Plex-like server for your [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro)-processed manga library. This guide explains how to use the features of the application after it has been installed.

For instructions on how to install and run the application, please see the [main project `README.md`](https://github.com/nguyenston/mokuro-library) on GitHub.

## What is Mokuro Library?

This project is different from the original browser-based Mokuro Reader.

* **Original Mokuro Reader:** A great, simple tool for quickly reading `.mokuro` files in your browser without any setup. It stores all data locally in your browser's storage.
* **Mokuro Library (This Project):** A **self-hosted, server-side** application that runs as a persistent service (e.g., on a home server or NAS).

Use Mokuro Library if you want to:
* Manage a large manga library without hitting browser storage quotas.
* Have a centralized library on your server's filesystem.
* Save your OCR text edits directly back to the `.mokuro` files on your disk.
* Sync your reading progress across multiple devices.
* Support multiple user accounts with separate progress and settings.
