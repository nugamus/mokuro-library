## Uploading Manga

### Prerequisites

Before uploading, ensure your manga has been processed with [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro):

```bash
# Example Mokuro processing command
mokuro --parent_dir "/path/to/manga" --disable_confirmation
```

This generates `.mokuro` JSON files containing OCR text data.

### Upload Process

1. Click the **menu button** (top right)
2. Select "**Upload**"
3. The upload modal appears

5. Choose your root manga directory
6. Wait for processing and upload

### Required Folder Structure

Mokuro Library expects a specific folder hierarchy:

```
📁 My Manga Collection/          ← Select this folder
├── 📁 Yotsuba&!/                ← Series folder
│   ├── 📁 Volume 1/             ← Image folder
│   │   ├── 🖼️ 001.jpg
│   │   ├── 🖼️ 002.jpg
│   │   ├── 🖼️ 003.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── 📁 Volume 2/
│   │   ├── 🖼️ 001.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── 📄 Volume 1.mokuro       ← OCR data file
│   ├── 📄 Volume 2.mokuro
│   └── 🖼️ Yotsuba&!.png         ← Series cover (optional)
│
├── 📁 Kaguya-sama/
│   ├── 📁 Chapter 1/
│   ├── 📁 Chapter 2/
│   ├── 📄 Chapter 1.mokuro
│   ├── 📄 Chapter 2.mokuro
│   └── 🖼️ Kaguya-sama.jpg
│
└── 📁 One Piece/
    └── ...
```

**Key Requirements:**

| Component | Location | Format |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Images | `<series>/<volume>/images/` | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp` |
| OCR Data | `<series>/<volume>.mokuro` | JSON file |
| Cover (optional) | `<series>/<series>.png/jpg` | Image file |

::: warning Important
- The `.mokuro` file must be **outside** the image folder
- The `.mokuro` filename must match the volume folder name exactly
- Image filenames don't need to be sequential (001, 002) but should be sortable
:::

### Upload Behavior

**Duplicate Handling:**
- Existing series/volumes are **not** overwritten
- Only new content is added to your library
- Reading progress is preserved

**Processing:**
- Server extracts metadata from folder names
- Cover images are automatically detected
- OCR data is parsed and stored
- Thumbnails are generated

::: tip Pro Tip
Organize your folder names well before uploading - they become your series and volume titles!

## Organizing Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Series Folders:**
```
✅ Yotsuba&!
✅ Kaguya-sama: Love is War
✅ One Piece
❌ yotsuba  (inconsistent capitalization)
❌ kaguya_sama  (prefer hyphens/spaces)
```

**Volume Folders:**
```
✅ Volume 01
✅ Volume 1
✅ Chapter 123
❌ v1  (too short, unclear)
❌ vol_01  (prefer spaces)
```

### Cover Images

- Use high-quality covers (at least 500px wide)
- Name cover files after the series
- Place in the series root folder
- Consistent aspect ratio across library

### Metadata Quality

- Fill in all available fields
- Use consistent author naming
- Add meaningful descriptions
- Tag appropriately for search

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

**"No valid manga found" error:**
- Check folder structure matches requirements
- Ensure `.mokuro` files exist
- Verify file permissions

**Upload hangs or times out:**
- Check file sizes (very large uploads may timeout)
- Verify server disk space
- Check network connection

### Missing Covers

**Series shows placeholder:**
- Add `<series-name>.png/jpg` to series folder
- Re-upload or manually set cover
- Check image file format

### Duplicate Series

**Same series appears twice:**
- Different folder names create separate series
- Use "Edit Metadata" to fix naming
- Delete duplicate and re-upload
