# Project Specification: Mokuro NAS Library

## Overview

### Project Goal

To create a self-hosted, multi-user Mokuro reader application that runs on a NAS. This application will solve the primary limitation of existing client-side readers by storing all library files and user data on the server's filesystem, bypassing browser storage quotas. This is also a project for me to get into web development.

### Target Use Case
1.  **Home Server (NAS):** A casual NAS owner hosting a manga library for a trusted group over LAN/VPN.
2.  **Local User (Windows):** A user who wants a "double-click to run" portable library on their PC without managing containers or databases.

### Core Architecture

The system will be a decoupled client-server application.

* Backend: A Node.js server (Fastify) handles all logic, database interactions, and file storage.
* Frontend: A SvelteKit application (refactored from zxy101/mokuro-reader) provides the web UI.
* Database: A server-side SQLite file will store all metadata.
* Deployment: The frontend and backend will be packaged to run together, either in a Docker container or a bundled Node exe.

## Feature Set

### Must-Haves (Minimum Viable Product)

1.  **Multi-User Authentication:**
    * [x] Users must be able to create an account and log in.
    * [x] The backend will use a simple, non-HTTPS-only cookie for session management, suitable for a trusted LAN/VPN environment.

2.  **Server-Side Library (Directory Upload-Style):**
    * [x] Authenticated users can upload content via the web UI. The upload modal will support two methods:
        * [x] ~~Single File Upload: .zip or .cbz files containing a single volume, \<series\_title\> will be pulled from inside the .mokuro file.~~ 
        * [x] Directory Upload: Users can select a "root" folder from their computer that contains pre-processed Mokuro output.
    * The backend will be able to parse the uploaded directory structure to find series and volumes based on the standard Mokuro output format:
        **Mokuro Output Structure:**
        * Image Files: root/\<series\_title\>/\<volume\_title\>/\<image\>.\<ext\>
        * Mokuro File: root/\<series\_title\>/\<volume\_title\>.mokuro
    * The backend will iterate through the uploaded file list, identify each series and volume, and populate the SQLite database, linking the new Series to the logged-in user's ID.
    * [x] Collision Handling: If an uploaded volume already exists in that user's library (based on series\_title and volume\_title), the server will ignore the uploaded volume and keep the existing data.

3.  **Per-User Progress & Settings:**
    * [x] All reading progress (current page, stats) will be saved to the database, linked to the specific user ID.
        * [x] Reading progress and read markers will be displayed on volume entry   
    * [x] All user-configurable settings (theme, reader behavior, etc.) will be saved to the database, linked to the user ID.

4.  **Manga Reader UI:**
	* [x] Core reader features
		* [x] Fetch and display the current page's image.
		* [x] Layout Mode: A toggle for Single Page vs. Dual-Page Spread (e.g., showing two pages side-by-side).
		* [x] Dual-Page offset: the ability to choose whether to start dual page from even or odd pages.
		* [x] Dual-Page reading direction: left to right or right to left.
		* [x] Ability to set the width of the side navigation buttons.
		* [x] Interactivity: Zoom and Pan the image(s).
	* [x] OCR overlay features
		* [x] Display editable OCR blocks as overlays.
		* [x] OCR blocks are only visible when hovered.
		* [x] Ensure these overlays correctly scale and pan with the base image.

5.  **OCR Editing (Write-Back):**
    * [x] Ability to delete, create, and change existing OCR blocks.
      * [x] Users can edit the textbox location (i.e. the four corners) of an OCR text box.
      * [x] Users can edit the text (content and font size) within an OCR text box.
    * [x] A "Save" button will send the modified text data to the backend.
    * [x] The backend will verify the user owns the volume, read the corresponding .mokuro file from the disk, update its JSON content, and save the changes.

### Nice-to-Haves (Post-MVP)

* [x] Optional Reader features
  * [x] Smart resize mode that auto fit the text content to the bounding box.
  * [x] Per user persistent reader settings.
  * [x] A single, long-scrolling vertical layout (webtoon mode).
  * [x] Caching images to avoid unnecessary server calls.
  * [ ] Customization
    * [x] Custom keymapping
    * [ ] Custom ligatures
* [ ] History/undo/redo for OCR edits
* [ ] The ability to export the library in different format (e.g. pdf, cbz, ...)
  * [x] zip
  * [x] pdf with selectable text
  * [ ] cbz (low priority)
  * [ ] metadata only
* [ ] Library features
  * [ ] More secure cookie (auth) implementation for more public use cases.
  * [x] The ability to rename series and volume.
  * [x] Search, sort, and paginate.
  * [ ] Implement the UI to display reading stats (time, characters read), which will be tracked in the database.
  * [ ] Import and manage content without OCR
  * [ ] Bundle mokuro into backend for OCR generation
  * [x] Contribution summary dashboard (ahead/merged/pending counts; rebase queue)
* [ ] AnkiConnect Integration: Focuses on sentence mining, as dictionary extensions like Yomi-tan already have word mining down.
