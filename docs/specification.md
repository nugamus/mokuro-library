# Project Specification: Mokuro NAS Library

## Overview

### Project Goal

To create a self-hosted, multi-user Mokuro reader application that runs on a NAS. This application will solve the primary limitation of existing client-side readers by storing all library files and user data on the server's filesystem, bypassing browser storage quotas.

### Target Use Case

A casual NAS owner who wants to host a manga library for a small, trusted group of users (family, friends) over a private network (LAN or VPN).

### Core Architecture

The system will be a decoupled client-server application.

* Backend: A Node.js server (Fastify) handles all logic, database interactions, and file storage.
* Frontend: A SvelteKit application (refactored from zxy101/mokuro-reader) provides the web UI.
* Database: A server-side SQLite file will store all metadata.
* Deployment: The frontend and backend will be packaged to run together, ideally in a single Docker container.

## Feature Set

### Must-Haves (Minimum Viable Product)

1.  **Multi-User Authentication:**
    * Users must be able to create an account and log in.
    * The backend will use a simple, non-HTTPS-only cookie for session management, suitable for a trusted LAN/VPN environment.

2.  **Server-Side Library (Directory Upload-Style):**
    * Authenticated users can upload content via the web UI. The upload modal will support two methods:
        1.  Single File Upload: .zip or .cbz files containing a single volume, \<series\_title\> will be pulled from inside the .mokuro file.
        2.  Directory Upload: Users can select a "root" folder from their computer that contains pre-processed Mokuro output.
    * The backend will be able to parse the uploaded directory structure to find series and volumes based on the standard Mokuro output format:
        **Mokuro Output Structure:**
        * Image Files: root/\<series\_title\>/\<volume\_title\>/\<image\>.\<ext\>
        * Mokuro File: root/\<series\_title\>/\<volume\_title\>.mokuro
    * The backend will iterate through the uploaded file list, identify each series and volume, and populate the SQLite database, linking the new Series to the logged-in user's ID.
    * Collision Handling: If an uploaded volume already exists in that user's library (based on series\_title and volume\_title), the server will ignore the uploaded volume and keep the existing data.

3.  **Per-User Progress & Settings:**
    * All reading progress (current page, stats) will be saved to the database, linked to the specific user ID.
        * Reading progress and read markers will be displayed on volume entry   
    * All user-configurable settings (theme, reader behavior, etc.) will be saved to the database, linked to the user ID.

4.  **Manga Reader UI:**
	* Core reader features (must-haves)
		* Fetch and display the current page's image.
		* Layout Mode: A toggle for Single Page vs. Dual-Page Spread (e.g., showing two pages side-by-side).
		* Dual-Page offset: the ability to choose whether to start dual page from even or odd pages
		* Dual-Page reading direction: left to right or right to left
		* Ability to set the width of the side navigation buttons
		* Interactivity: Zoom and Pan the image(s).
	* OCR features (must-haves)
		* Display editable OCR blocks as overlays.
		* OCR blocks are only visible when hovered.
		* Ensure these overlays correctly scale and pan with the base image.
		* Ability to delete, create, and change existing OCR blocks
		* A "Save" button to write changes back.
	* Optional features
		* Per user persistent reader settings
		* Webtoon Mode: A single, long-scrolling vertical layout.
		* Caching: Pre-loading the next and previous page images.

5.  **OCR Editing (Write-Back):**
    * Users can edit the text within an OCR text box.
    * Users can edit the textbox location (i.e. the four corners) of an OCR text box
    * A "Save" button will send the modified text data to the backend.
    * The backend will verify the user owns the volume, read the corresponding .mokuro file from the disk, update its JSON content, and save the changes.

### Nice-to-Haves (Post-MVP)

* Reading Statistics: Implement the UI to display reading stats (time, characters read), which will be tracked in the database.
* AnkiConnect Integration: Re-implement the AnkiConnect feature, linking settings to the server-side user account.

## Technology Stack

* Repository: Monorepo (contains frontend and backend packages).
* Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
* Backend: Node.js + Fastify + TypeScript.
* Database: SQLite (managed via Prisma ORM).

## Draft API "Contract"

All endpoints (except /auth) are protected and require an authenticated session cookie. All library-related endpoints are implicitly scoped to the logged-in user.

### Auth API (Public)

* **POST /api/auth/register**
    * Creates a new user.
* **POST /api/auth/login**
    * Creates a session cookie.
* **POST /api/auth/logout**
    * Clears the session cookie.
* **GET /api/auth/me**
    * Gets the currently logged-in user's data (username, settings).

### Library API (User-Scoped)

* **GET /api/library**
    * Gets a list of all Series and Volume metadata owned by the current user.
* **GET /api/library/series/:id**
    * Gets a specific Series and associated Volume metadata owned by the current user.
* **POST /api/library/upload**
    * Uploads new manga (~~zip~~ or directory) and associates it with the current user's ownerId.
* **POST /api/library/series/:id/cover**
    * Uploads and sets the cover image for a series.
* **GET /api/library/volume/:id**
    * Gets full data for one volume, including the parsed .mokuro JSON.
    * Fails (404/403) if the volume does not belong to the current user.
* **PUT /api/library/volume/:id/ocr**
    * Saves modified OCR data.
    * Fails if the volume does not belong to the current user.
* **DELETE /api/library/volume/:id or DELETE /api/library/series/:id**

    * Saves/updates the UserProgress for a volume for the current user.

### File API (User-Scoped)

* **GET /api/files/volume/:id/image/:imageName**
    * Securely serves a specific manga page image.
    * Fails if the volume does not belong to the current user.
* **GET /api/files/series/:id/cover**
    * Securely serves the cover image for a series.
    * Fails if the series does not belong to the current user.

## Draft Database Schema (Prisma)

  coverPath String? // Path to the cover image

  volumes Volume[]
  owner   User     @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  ownerId String // Which user uploaded this

  @@unique([title, ownerId]) // A user can't have two series with the same title
}

// Stores metadata about a single volume
model Volume {
  id        String @id @default(cuid())
  title     String // e.g., "Volume 1"

  mokuroPath String @unique // Path to the .mokuro file

  series   Series @relation(fields: [seriesId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  seriesId String

  progress UserProgress[]

  @@unique([seriesId, title]) // Prevent duplicate volumes within a series
}

  username String @unique
  password String // Will store a hash

  settings Json // All reader settings

  uploads  Series[]
  progress UserProgress[]

model UserProgress {
  id        String  @id @default(cuid())
  page      Int     @default(1)
  timeRead  Int     @default(0) // in minutes
  charsRead Int     @default(0)
